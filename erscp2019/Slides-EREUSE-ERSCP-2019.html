    <meta name="description" content="What is circular consumption of electronics? Is it measurable? Can we set goals or compare with other consumers? A principle of circular economy is durability, prolonging the useful life of products. If we move the principle to the function of consumption, we would have that: circular consumption is to make the most of time resources by ensuring that in the end they are recycled, but never before time or prematurely, but only when they can no longer be used or reused by anyone else. In this article we propose a set of measures, metrics and progress indicators to measure the use of resources that consumers make in their use phase. With these metrics we can identify which consumers are the most circular; those who are able to use the same electronic devices for the longest time, either internally, or by collaborating with external agents so that these devices are reused and recycled properly. We have been able to validate usage performance metrics and premature recycling in the analysis of more than 3,000 desktop and laptop type electronic devices. These devices have been discarded by hundreds of organisations in 2018 and 2019. Finally, we propose the metrics of durability and obsolescence for models and brands of devices, which although it does not allow us to know the reasons for a low durability; absence or high cost of spare parts, difficulty of repair, etc., it does allow us to elaborate a ranking so that consumers can reward with their consumption choice, manufacturers who make products that reach high thresholds of durability." />

***

[comment]: <> (For example, if the write speed of a hard drive is at percentile 10, this feature would get 10% of the possible points of the hard drive's speed feature. The characteristics of the components (e.g. write/read speed, size) and the components (e.g. disk, memory) are then merged together by weighted harmonic averages. )

- Capture method: A software collects the performance of the devices at component level and scores them according to a comparison with other devices registered in the system.

- Formula: Aggregates in a single value the measures for all its components (disc, memory, processor, etc...). The resulting value ranges from 0 to 5, never reaching 5. The use value of a device over time tends to decay as its performance declines to lower percentiles.

  ## How does it work?
### - Markdown
]
.right-column[
A Markdown-formatted chunk of text is transformed into individual slides by JavaScript running in the browser:

```remark
# Slide 1
This is slide 1

---

# Slide 2
This is slide 2
```

.slides[
  .first[
  ### Slide 1
  This is slide 1
  ]
  .second[
  ### Slide 2
  This is slide 2
  ]
]

Regular Markdown rules apply with only a single exception:

  - A line containing three dashes constitutes a new slide
  (not a horizontal rule, `&lt;hr /&gt;`)

Have a look at the [Markdown website](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if you're not familiar with Markdown formatting.
]

.left-column[
  ## How does it work?
  ### - Markdown
  ### - Inside HTML
]
.right-column[
A simple HTML document is needed for hosting the styles, Markdown and the generated slides themselves:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style type="text/css">
      /* Slideshow styles */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
*    <textarea id="source">
      <!-- Slideshow Markdown -->
    &lt;/textarea&gt;

    </script>
    <script>
*      var slideshow = remark.create();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You may download remark to have your slideshow not depend on any online resources, or reference the [latest version](http://remarkjs.com/downloads/remark-latest.min.js) online directly.

  ## Markdown extensions
]
.right-column[
To help out with slide layout and formatting, a few Markdown extensions have been included:

- Slide properties, for naming, styling and templating slides

- Content classes, for styling specific content

- Syntax highlighting, supporting a range of languages

  ### - Slide properties
]
.right-column[
Initial lines containing key-value pairs are extracted as slide properties:

```remark
name: agenda
class: middle, center

# Agenda

The name of this slide is {{ name }}.
```

Slide properties serve multiple purposes:

* Naming and styling slides using properties `name` and `class`

* Using slides as templates using properties `template` and `layout`

* Expansion of `{{ property }}` expressions to property values

See the [complete list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#slide-properties) of slide properties.

Any occurences of one or more dotted CSS class names followed by square brackets are replaced with the contents of the brackets with the specified classes applied:

Code blocks can be syntax highlighted by specifying a language from the set of [supported languages](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting).

Using [GFM](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) fenced code blocks you can easily specify highlighting language:

.pull-left[

<pre><code>```javascript

  return a + b
end
```</code></pre>
]
.pull-right[

<pre><code>```ruby
def add(a, b)

A number of highlighting [styles](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Configuration#highlighting) are available, including several well-known themes from different editors and IDEs.

To help out with giving presentations, a presenter mode comprising the
following features is provided:

Just like three dashes separate slides,
three question marks separate slide content from slide notes:

```
Slide 1 content

*???

Slide 1 notes

---

Slide 2 content

*???

Slide 2 notes
```

Slide notes are also treated as Markdown, and will be converted in the
same manner slide content is.

Pressing __P__ will toggle presenter mode.

Congratulations, you just toggled presenter mode!

Now press __P__ to toggle it back off.

Presenter mode of course makes no sense to the audience.

Creating a cloned view of your slideshow lets you:

- Move the cloned view to the extended display visible to the audience

- Put the original slideshow in presenter mode

- Navigate as usual, and the cloned view will automatically keep up with the original

Pressing __C__ will open a cloned view of the current slideshow in a new
browser window.
