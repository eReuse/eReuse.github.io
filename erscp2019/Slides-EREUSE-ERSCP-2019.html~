    <meta name="description" content="What is circular consumption of electronics? Is it measurable? Can we set goals or compare with other consumers? A principle of circular economy is durability, prolonging the useful life of products. If we move the principle to the function of consumption, we would have that: circular consumption is to make the most of time resources by ensuring that in the end they are recycled, but never before time or prematurely, but only when they can no longer be used or reused by anyone else. In this article we propose a set of measures, metrics and progress indicators to measure the use of resources that consumers make in their use phase. With these metrics we can identify which consumers are the most circular; those who are able to use the same electronic devices for the longest time, either internally, or by collaborating with external agents so that these devices are reused and recycled properly. We have been able to validate usage performance metrics and premature recycling in the analysis of more than 3,000 desktop and laptop type electronic devices. These devices have been discarded by hundreds of organisations in 2018 and 2019. Finally, we propose the metrics of durability and obsolescence for models and brands of devices, which although it does not allow us to know the reasons for a low durability; absence or high cost of spare parts, difficulty of repair, etc., it does allow us to elaborate a ranking so that consumers can reward with their consumption choice, manufacturers who make products that reach high thresholds of durability." />

## Conclusions and discussion

 1. Approach:  Focuse on usage phase and value of use when recycling to measure circularity of consumption and products.  

 2.

four measures, software instruments, metrics and indicators for measure circularity of consumers and products
   
[comment]: <> (Our approach to measuring circularity in the consumption and production of electronic devices is to focus on the performance achieved in their use phase.  Performing these measurements at certain times of their usage cycle and with their respective instruments we define the metrics proposed to measure the circularity of consumers and products.)
   
 2. Measures: Is it realistic and feasible to collect hours of use? value of use? usage and recycling rates?
   
[comment]: <> ( We have four measures: the 1. usage hours, 2. performance, 3. usage rate, 4. recycling rate. In order to know the durability of the device in all its usage phases it is necessary to analyse all the hard drives it has had. The necessary instrument to collect the measurement of usage hours is a software that analyses the variables in the hard drive. In order to know the durability of the device throughout its usage phase, it is necessary to analyse all the hard drives it had. We propose that each time the data is wiped from the drive, either because there is a drive replacement or because it is reused by another user, the data erasure software employed notifies the serial number of the device, of the hard drive and the usage hours. Aggregating this information would allow to have all the hours of its usage cycles. When a hard disk is discarded, data is usually erased. We propose that it is just at the time of data erasure when data is reported: serial number of the hard disk, the serial number of the device and the hours made by the hard disk. Is it a trusted and irreversible data repository (a blockchain) the place where to store this information in order to be able to analyse it and know the total durability? DECIR QUE TENEMOS EL USAGE AND RECYCLING RATES PARA UN SUBCONJUNTO )
   
 3. Metrics validated with 3000 devices in first usage cycle (not in reuse): Usage hours per device, durability, utilization, upgradeability. Not validated: reusability, potential, obsolescence by model and premature recycling.
   
[comment]: <> (The study carried out with more than 3,000 devices has allowed us to validate the metrics of: first cycle hours of use of the device, total hours of use of the device, durability of the model in hours of use, performance of the device in hours of use, maximum value of use of the model and current upgradeability of the device. As there we do not have all information about model usage and recyling rates, , it has not been possible to validate the metrics of current reusability, potential, obsolescence by model and premature recycling.)
   
 4. Consumers base their election on brand durability history. Can this have an impact?
